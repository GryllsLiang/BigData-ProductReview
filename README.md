# Configuration:Python 3.10.6, Spark 3.3.2, Scala 2.12.15, java version "1.8.0_341", Runs on MacOS X Version 12.5.1
# use command: spark-submit SparkProgram.py reviews_Video_Games.json meta_Video_Games.json out.txt to run the code
# This project is aiming at practicing using pyspark (RDD files, map-reduce function, join, aggregate calculation, sorting) to find the top 15 products with the greatest number of reviews in a day, as well as the reviewing data, rating and brand.
# The appendix is some reference for configuring the demanded environment.
# Since the reviews_Video_Games.json is too large, I do not upload it in the repo.
